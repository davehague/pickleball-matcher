3. **Match Confirmation**
   - You have 24 hours to confirm or decline the proposed match
   - All four players must confirm for the match to be finalized
   - If anyone declines, the match is dissolved, and the declining player is marked unavailable for that time slot

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is the host for each match determined?**  
A: The system rotates hosting duties fairly among all players in the group. The rotation ensures that everyone takes turns being responsible for reservations, and no one person is burdened with hosting too frequently.

**Q: What should I do if I can't make the reservation as the host?**  
A: If you're unable to fulfill your hosting duties, use the "Message Group" button to communicate with your match group. Another player can volunteer to make the reservation instead, though you'll still be in the hosting rotation for future matches.

**Q: Who makes the court reservations?**  
A: The designated "host" for each match is responsible for making the court reservation. You'll clearly see when you're the host on your match card and in the hosting summary on your Matches page.

**Q: Do I need to collect payment from other players?**  
A: Yes, if you're the host and the courts require payment, you're responsible for collecting the court fees from the other players. This is typically handled at the courts before play.

**Q: What happens if I need to cancel at the last minute?**  
A: Use the "Cancel" button and then the "Message Group" feature to communicate with your group. Players marked as "willing to be substitutes" will be notified of the opening. If you were the host, another player will need to take over the hosting responsibilities.

**Q: Can I play more than my set weekly frequency if I want to?**  
A: Yes! You can always update your weekly frequency. Additionally, being a "substitute" allows you to be invited to games beyond your regular limit.

**Q: How does the system pick which courts to use?**  
A: The system prioritizes locations marked as "Preferred" by all four matched players. If there's no consensus, it selects locations that are at least "OK" for everyone.

**Q: What's the benefit of having DUPR ratings in the system?**  
A: DUPR ratings help players identify others at similar skill levels. While the app doesn't currently match based on ratings, it's useful information for the group.
